# MAC Output Calculation

This module performs a Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operation using the formula:


where:

- **A**: `bf16` (Brain Floating Point 16) type
- **B**: `bf16` type
- **C**: `fp32` (Floating Point 32) type

## Data Type Specifications

### bf16 (Brain Floating Point 16)
- **Total Bits**: 16
- **Sign Bit**: 1 bit
- **Exponent**: 8 bits
- **Mantissa**: 7 bits (with an implicit leading 1)

The **bf16** format is a reduced-precision version of **fp32** (standard single-precision floating point). It uses fewer bits in the mantissa, which can reduce computational requirements and memory usage, but at the cost of precision in fractional parts.

### fp32 (Floating Point 32)
- **Total Bits**: 32
- **Sign Bit**: 1 bit
- **Exponent**: 8 bits
- **Mantissa**: 23 bits (with an implicit leading 1)

The **fp32** format is the standard IEEE 754 single-precision floating point format, which provides a wide range and greater precision compared to **bf16**, making it suitable for accumulative operations where higher accuracy is needed.

## Overview of Calculation Flow

1. **Multiplication**: The `bf16` values **A** and **B** are multiplied. 
2. **Conversion to fp32**: The result of `A * B` is then converted to `fp32` by extending the mantissa.
3. **Accumulation**: This `fp32` result is added to operand **C** (already in `fp32` format), giving the final MAC output in `fp32` format.

## Multiplication of bf16 Types

When performing multiplication between two `bf16` values, **A** and **B**, the process involves aligning the formats and converting them to achieve an accurate result within the constraints of reduced-precision `bf16`.

### Steps in bf16 Multiplication

1. **Extract Fields**: 
   - Each `bf16` operand has three components:
     - **Sign Bit** (1 bit)
     - **Exponent** (8 bits)
     - **Mantissa** (7 bits, with an implicit leading 1)

2. **Multiply the Mantissas**:
   - The mantissas of **A** and **B** are multiplied. Since `bf16` has only 7 mantissa bits, this multiplication can produce up to a 14-bit result. This intermediate product is temporarily in higher precision to capture more significant bits.

3. **Add the Exponents**:
   - The exponents of **A** and **B** are added together, and a bias (127 for IEEE 754 formats) is subtracted to maintain the proper range in `fp32` or `bf16` representation.

4. **Determine the Sign Bit**:
   - The result's sign is determined by XORâ€™ing the sign bits of **A** and **B**.

5. **Normalize the Result**:
   - If the mantissa product exceeds 7 bits, the result is normalized by shifting and adjusting the exponent accordingly to fit within the `bf16` format.

6. **Round to Nearest**:
   - To keep the precision within `bf16` limits, the result is rounded to the nearest `bf16` format, typically by truncating the excess bits in the mantissa and adjusting based on the discarded bits.

7. **Conversion to fp32**:
   - After obtaining the `bf16` multiplication result, it is converted to `fp32` by extending the mantissa to 23 bits (with trailing zeros) and retaining the sign and exponent fields, making it ready for further operations in `fp32`.
