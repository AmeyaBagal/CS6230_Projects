# MAC Output Calculation

This module performs a Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operation using the formula:


where:

- **A**: `bf16` (Brain Floating Point 16) type
- **B**: `bf16` type
- **C**: `fp32` (Floating Point 32) type

## Data Type Specifications

### bf16 (Brain Floating Point 16)
- **Total Bits**: 16
- **Sign Bit**: 1 bit
- **Exponent**: 8 bits
- **Mantissa**: 7 bits (with an implicit leading 1)

The **bf16** format is a reduced-precision version of **fp32** (standard single-precision floating point). It uses fewer bits in the mantissa, which can reduce computational requirements and memory usage, but at the cost of precision in fractional parts.

### fp32 (Floating Point 32)
- **Total Bits**: 32
- **Sign Bit**: 1 bit
- **Exponent**: 8 bits
- **Mantissa**: 23 bits (with an implicit leading 1)

The **fp32** format is the standard IEEE 754 single-precision floating point format, which provides a wide range and greater precision compared to **bf16**, making it suitable for accumulative operations where higher accuracy is needed.

## Overview of Calculation Flow

1. **Multiplication**: The `bf16` values **A** and **B** are multiplied. 
2. **Conversion to fp32**: The result of `A * B` is then converted to `fp32` by extending the mantissa.
3. **Accumulation**: This `fp32` result is added to operand **C** (already in `fp32` format), giving the final MAC output in `fp32` format.
